# hypertumor
This project started for a final project for a discpline I did during the first year of my Masters, hence the name of the code for now. 
My goal was to use genetic algorithm to find the best parameters to describe hypertumor growth behavior using a cellular automaton (game of life).
There is also a report I wrote for the discipline (report.pdf)

## Current Status
This project is not finished as I am still revising some of the previous functions.
